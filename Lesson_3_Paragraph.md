Paragraph Element:

The HTML p element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

Ex:

    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of lines
    in the source code,
    but the browser
    ignores it.
    </p>

    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of spaces
    in the source code,
    but the browser
    ignores it.
    </p>

Output:

This paragraph contains a lot of lines in the source code, but the browser ignores it.

This paragraph contains a lot of spaces in the source code, but the browser ignores it.
