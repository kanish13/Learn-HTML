Multipages:

We can link different web page into a html age

Ex:

    <a href="pages/about.html">About this site</a>

Here you can see that inside href, we have added “pages/about.html” . “pages” is folder name in which “about.html” is saved .  and “about.html” is a file name of html page

My Example:
