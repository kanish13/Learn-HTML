HTML File Paths:

A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

Absolute File Paths

An absolute file path is the full URL to a file

Ex:

    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

Relative File Paths

A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:

Ex:

    <img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
